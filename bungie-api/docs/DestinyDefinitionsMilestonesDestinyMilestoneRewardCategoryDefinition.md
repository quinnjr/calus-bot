**reward_entries** | [**::std::collections::HashMap<String, ::models::DestinyDefinitionsMilestonesDestinyMilestoneRewardEntryDefinition>**](Destiny.Definitions.Milestones.DestinyMilestoneRewardEntryDefinition.md) | If this milestone can provide rewards, this will define the sets of rewards that can be earned, the conditions under which they can be acquired, internal data that we&#39;ll use at runtime to determine whether you&#39;ve already earned or redeemed this set of rewards, and the category that this reward should be placed under. | [optional] [default to null]
**order** | **i32** | If you want to use BNet&#39;s recommended order for rendering categories programmatically, use this value and compare it to other categories to determine the order in which they should be rendered.
