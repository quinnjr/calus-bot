## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**membership_id** | **i64** | Every Destiny Profile has a membershipId. This is provided on the character as well for convenience. | [optional] [default to null]
**membership_type** | **i32** | membershipType tells you the platform on which the character plays. Examine the BungieMembershipType enumeration for possible values. | [optional] [default to null]
**character_id** | **i64** | The unique identifier for the character. | [optional] [default to null]
**date_last_played** | **String** | The last date that the user played Destiny. | [optional] [default to null]
**minutes_played_this_session** | **i64** | If the user is currently playing, this is how long they&#39;ve been playing. | [optional] [default to null]
**minutes_played_total** | **i64** | If this value is 525,600, then they played Destiny for a year. Or they&#39;re a very dedicated Rent fan. Note that this includes idle time, not just time spent actually in activities shooting things. | [optional] [default to null]
**light** | **i32** | The user&#39;s calculated \&quot;Light Level\&quot;. Light level is an indicator of your power that mostly matters in the end game, once you&#39;ve reached the maximum character level: it&#39;s a level that&#39;s dependent on the average Attack/Defense power of your items. | [optional] [default to null]
**stats** | **::std::collections::HashMap<String, i32>** | Your character&#39;s stats, such as Agility, Resilience, etc... *not* historical stats.  You&#39;ll have to call a different endpoint for those. | [optional] [default to null]
**race_hash** | **i32** | Use this hash to look up the character&#39;s DestinyRaceDefinition. | [optional] [default to null]
**gender_hash** | **i32** | Use this hash to look up the character&#39;s DestinyGenderDefinition. | [optional] [default to null]
**class_hash** | **i32** | Use this hash to look up the character&#39;s DestinyClassDefinition. | [optional] [default to null]
**race_type** | **i32** | Mostly for historical purposes at this point, this is an enumeration for the character&#39;s race.  It&#39;ll be preferable in the general case to look up the related definition: but for some people this was too convenient to remove. | [optional] [default to null]
**class_type** | **i32** | Mostly for historical purposes at this point, this is an enumeration for the character&#39;s class.  It&#39;ll be preferable in the general case to look up the related definition: but for some people this was too convenient to remove. | [optional] [default to null]
**gender_type** | **i32** | Mostly for historical purposes at this point, this is an enumeration for the character&#39;s Gender.  It&#39;ll be preferable in the general case to look up the related definition: but for some people this was too convenient to remove. And yeah, it&#39;s an enumeration and not a boolean. Fight me. | [optional] [default to null]
**emblem_path** | **String** | A shortcut path to the user&#39;s currently equipped emblem image. If you&#39;re just showing summary info for a user, this is more convenient than examining their equipped emblem and looking up the definition. | [optional] [default to null]
**emblem_background_path** | **String** | A shortcut path to the user&#39;s currently equipped emblem background image. If you&#39;re just showing summary info for a user, this is more convenient than examining their equipped emblem and looking up the definition. | [optional] [default to null]
**emblem_hash** | **i32** | The hash of the currently equipped emblem for the user. Can be used to look up the DestinyInventoryItemDefinition. | [optional] [default to null]

**level_progression** | [***Value**](Value.md) | The progression that indicates your character&#39;s level. Not their light level, but their character level: you know, the thing you max out a couple hours in and then ignore for the sake of light level. | [optional] [default to null]
**base_character_level** | **i32** | The \&quot;base\&quot; level of your character, not accounting for any light level. | [optional] [default to null]
**percent_to_next_level** | **f32** | A number between 0 and 100, indicating the whole and fractional % remaining to get to the next character level. | [optional] [default to null]
