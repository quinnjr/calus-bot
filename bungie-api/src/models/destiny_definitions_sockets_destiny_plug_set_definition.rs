/// DestinyDefinitionsSocketsDestinyPlugSetDefinition : Sometimes, we have large sets of reusable plugs that are defined identically and thus can (and in some cases, are so large that they *must*) be shared across the places where they are used. These are the definitions for those reusable sets of plugs.    See DestinyItemSocketEntryDefinition.plugSource and reusablePlugSetHash for the relationship between these reusable plug sets and the sockets that leverage them (for starters, Emotes).   As of the release of Shadowkeep (Late 2019), these will begin to be sourced from game content directly - which means there will be many more of them, but it also means we may not get all data that we used to get for them.   DisplayProperties, in particular, will no longer be guaranteed to contain valid information. We will make a best effort to guess what ought to be populated there where possible, but it will be invalid for many/most plug sets.
